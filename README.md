# Arxiv RSS Manager
An rss arxiv reader created using Godot, which allows one to build up a database of arxiv articles

# Executable
Download the Godot Engine Release from [here](https://godotengine.org/download/). Then open this as a new project, if you want a stand-alone executable; [export the project](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/workflow/export/exporting_projects.html)
